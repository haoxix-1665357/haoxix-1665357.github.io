The best way to run my code is in the jupyter notebook. To run them on the jupyter note,
you need to copy the code in main.py and paste to a new ipynb file in jupyter notebook,
and do the same way for data_process.py, since I think the jupyter notebook cannot run
the .py file directly.
To run my code, the one you need to run is the 'main.py'.
I uploaded the two csv files to the gradescope, and you can download it and upload
them to the Jupyter notebook.
